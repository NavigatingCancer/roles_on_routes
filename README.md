# Roles On Routes

Roles On Routes was written by Navigating Cancer.

It allows defining user roles for authorization directly on the routes to which they apply.

It may not be the best solution. Maybe something open source would be better.

Defines div_with_roles, li_with_roles, tr_with_roles, td_with_roles, ul_with_roles, and ol_with_roles. (See tags_with_roles.rb.)
